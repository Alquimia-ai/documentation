Complex, self-contained components that combine multiple molecules and atoms to create sophisticated UI patterns. These organisms are more complex than molecules, and oriented to handle assistant related functionality.

> This page is under construction. We are working on documenting our organism-level components that handle complex assistant interactions, chat interfaces, and other sophisticated UI patterns. Check back soon for detailed documentation and examples.
